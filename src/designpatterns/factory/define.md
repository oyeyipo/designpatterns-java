# Factory Design Patterns

**Abstract Factory** provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete.

**Factory Method** defines an interface for creating an object but subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.
