# Template Method Pattern

**The template method pattern** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

- The Strategy and Template Method Patterns both encapsulate algorithms, The first by composition and the other by inheritance.
- Factory Method is a specialization of Template Method.
